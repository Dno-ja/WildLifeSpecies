# WildLifeSpecies
This project focuses on automating the identification of wildlife species using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It emphasizes recognizing rare and endangered species from noisy, low-resolution camera trap images, supporting conservation efforts by reducing manual monitoring.
